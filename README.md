### Hi there 👋

<!--
**bwbroersma/bwbroersma** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working for the [Netherlands Standardisation Forum](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/en/netherlands-standardisation-forum),  which facilitates digital cooperation (interoperability) between government organizations and between government, businesses and citizens
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ZIP, ASN.1, ODF and OPC file formats
- 💬 Ask me anything about [EML_NL](https://www.kiesraad.nl/verkiezingen/osv-en-eml/eml-standaard)¹, JQ, bash, xmlstarlet and PL/pgSQL
- 📫 How to reach me, see my email or 🐦 ([**@bwbroersma**](https://twitter.com/bwbroersma))
- ⚡ Fun fact: I mail and [tweet](https://twitter.com/BWBroersma/status/1375181703183007746) too many oneliners to colleagues

¹ I used to work for the Electoral Council of the Netherlands ([**@kiesraad**](https://github.com/kiesraad)), an electoral management body
